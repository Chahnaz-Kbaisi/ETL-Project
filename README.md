# Project Description:

This project assesses the prescribing of opioid drugs across the US from 1999 to 2014, focusing on changes in prescription rates at Veterans Affairs sites from 2012 to 2018, and details relevant information on the types of medical facilities and dispensers that provide them. It describes the rate of usage by race, education and family income. The analysis also shows the rates of overdose that have led to death in the US. Using claims for medically-assisted treatment and deaths from overdose from counties in California, we will determine if there is an association between seeking treatment for opioid abuse and subsequent death. 

# Research Areas:

After picking a topic, we developed some key questions to inform our data search. Then, we narrowed down the unfiltered data to a few datasets for each part to then take a closer look and pick the sets that could potentially be analyzed to answer our key questions. We used a team approach by which every member was able to engage in each of the steps so that learning, usage and application would be as comprehensive as possible. Each team member studied their respective dataset and then downloaded the files to begin the extraction step

## The Three Key areas we investigated are:
